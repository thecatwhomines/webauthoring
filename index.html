<h2 id="HTML">HTML </h2>
<br><p> HTML, or <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, was first created by Tim Berners-Lee as the markup language for the Worldwide Web in 1991, though it was only released in 1995 as HTML 2.0.
  In the years since, it has become the default markup language for almost every webpage on the internet. Listed below are some of the HTML version that have been used through the years: </p> <br>

<h4> HTML 2.0 </h4> <br> 

<!-- paragraph, HTML 2.0 --> 

<div><p> Prior to the release of HTML 2.0, the language had not yet been standardised, and there was quite a bit of documentation concerning what HTML was capable of.
  Over time, the internet became more and more popular, and it became clear that the internet needed a standardised form of HTML to refer to, which led to the creation of HTML 2.0 in 1995.
Developed in 1995 by the Internet Engineering Task Force, 2.0 introduced features like user input forms and tables, considerably improving how users could interact with sites on the internet. (Webcraftingcode, 2024) </p>

<!-- subheading, HTML 3.2 --> 

<h4> HTML 3.2 </h4> <br>
<!--paragraph, HTML 3.2-->

<p>As the 1990s continued, HTML became more and more popular, with more and more web developers learning how to use the language. These web developers wished for more ways to customise their websites, and eventually
Netscape extension tags were created to this end. However, due to the size of the overhaul, HTML 3.0 was abandoned and the new standard, HTML 3.2, was not introduced until January of 1997. Most of the extension tags introduced by Netscape were scrapped,
and HTML 3.2 quickly became the new standard on which most browsers were built. (Your HTML source, 2012)


</p><br>
<!-- subheading, HTML 4.01 --> 

<h4> HTML 4.01 </h4> <br> 
<!--paragraph, HTML 4.01-->
<p>HTML 4.01 was first proposed in 1997 as HTML 4.0, being released as 4.01 in April 1998 due to the W3C discovering some problems in the source code of 4.0. Of particular note with 4.01 was the 22 new elements added to the specification,
such as <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr.</abbr>, which allows a word to be abbreviated and only shown in full when the user hovers over it, or the similar in function acronym element. frame and frameset were also officially integrated into 4.01 after
years of being in use unofficially. 4.01 also added five new attributes to improve stylesheet functionality. (Your HTML source, 2012) </p><br>
<!-- subheading, HTML 5.1 --> 
<h4> HTML 5.1 </h4> <br>

<p> HTML 5.1 was released in 2016, with HTML 5 taking over a decade to become the new standard. Shortly after 5's release, work on 5.1 began, with the W3C and Tim Berners-Lee both agreeing that 5.1 was the superior standard.
5.1 added a considerable amount of refinements to HTML; it allows for the picture and srcset attributes to pick images more quickly, and there are elements for controlling where the user can look when going through their history.
Some features such as the appCache and the command API were removed, and header and footer elements were changed so that they can be nested. (W3C, 2016)

<h2 id="CSS"> CSS </h2>
<p>CSS, otherwise known as <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>, is a language used to change the style of how a website is presented. First developed in 1996, CSS has seen several different iterations over the years that have developed many new features. </p>

<!--CSS 1 paragraph-->
<h4>CSS 1</h4>
<br>
<p>Work on CSS 1 first began in 1994, with the standard being released by the W3C in 1996, having been created mainly by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.
 CSS 1's main purpose was to separate the actual material of a page and how it looked to the user, lending itself to a mutually beneficial relationship with HTML.
CSS 1 introduced basic styling features like fonts, text colours, and page backgrounds, as well as selectors so developers can choose which parts of their website to stylise. To
quote Bert Bos directly: <blockquote><q>The battles within the HTML ERB were long and hard, but CSS level 1 finally emerged as a W3C Recommendation in December 1996.</blockquote></q>
CSS was supported by browsers such as Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and Opera, and received a W3C working group in 1997. (W3, Bert Bos, 2016)</p><br>
<!--CSS 2 paragraph-->
<h4>CSS 2.0</h4><br>
<p>CSS 2 was launched in 1998, not long after CSS 1. It added new features such as an improved layout options for positioning elements and floating elements.
It allowed the developer of a website to use the display property to control how a webpage shows different elements, and added the option for different media types such as screen
and print. It also added the option for bidirectional text, which improved its support for different scripts globally. CSS 2 had the ability to embed fonts in a web document,
however only Internet Explorer implemented that feature in CSS 2's ten year lifespan. (Amit Dhiman, 2023)
</p><br>
<!--CSS 2.1 paragraph-->
<h4>CSS 2.1</h4><br>
<p>CSS 2.1 was predominantly a refinement of CSS 2.0, released in 2011. It was intend to update and replace CSS 2.0, and removed and fixed some of the problems and uneven features of CSS 2.0, improving cross-browser 
compatability for HTML webpages and introducing features that would become commonplace in CSS 3.0, like the colour properties of rgba and hsl. CSS 2.1 also removed some features that were
deemed not useful or simply not incorporated often by the CSS developer community.(W3.org, 2024) </p><br>
<!--CSS 3 paragraph-->
<h4>CSS 3.0</h4><br>
<p>CSS 3 is the most recent CSS standard released to the public in 2012, developed by the W3C. With CSS 3, you can use the background-image property to set a background for your
HTML page, and background-size can be used to determine how big the background element is. CSS 3 also allows you to arrange vertical and horizontal elements more easily with the
flexbox feautre, as well as the flex-wrap and justify-content properties. CSS 3 allows for rem values to adjust the font size of a webpage's different sections; if the webpage 
has a font size of 30px, then the developer can set a .5rem for a given section and display a half-sized font of 15px for that section. (Codeacademy, 2024)</p><br>
